		<h2>Aviation</h2>
		<p>Aviation has been a passion of mine since my childhood. When I was a boy, my father learned to fly. And while he never got his license, watching him pore over books and charts sparked an interest in me. Finding points of interest on a sectional chart, tracing the dark pencil-lines of his routes with my fingers, and reading the arcane words of general aviation sparked something inside of me.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>The Beginning</h3>
		<p>In the beginning, I watched planes. When my father would fly over the house, my grandmother and I would race outside and look into the skies, tracing the drone of the engine to a tiny plane high above, wings waggling a hello as he passed above. I would play with model planes, and built elaborate flying machines out of legos, imagining myself at the helm of everything from a biplane to an interstellar star cruiser. </p>
		<p>Eventually, my fantasies began to congeal together into a vague idea that I should do something more real. And so it was that at age 14 I used my powers of persuasion to convince my parents to sign me up for flying lessons. Still too young to drive, uninterested in cars, I went to the airport for my lessons. Sometimes my parents took me; sometimes I rode my bike. Often, I watched the workings of the ramp, seeing planes taxi about and taking in the fine details of these marvelous flying machines. </p>
